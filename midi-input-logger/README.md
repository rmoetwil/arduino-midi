# Midi Input Logger

This program is written and tested with Teensy 3.2 + Audio Shield.

It reads midi and prints all output to the Serial Monitor.

Yes there are more and easier ways to this but this was just getting my hands dirty (a little bit) with actual Arduino 'coding'.

I tested this with my Arturia BeatStep Pro and used Pure Data to connect midi input to the Teensy.
